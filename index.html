<p class = "pri"> Okay great, lets get started. So this is just like a demo site on learning how to actually do web development.<br> 
So I'm not really the best at making websites, but I'm certainly very keen on actually giving it a shot and improving my skills in it.
<br> I seriously think I can make some <strong>moola</strong> off of it </p>

<p> Great so let's move on, I don't have a lot of time to actually make this demo, So over the next week it'll change extremely quickly and become an absolute masterpiece
